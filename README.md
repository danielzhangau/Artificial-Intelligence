# Artificial-Intelligence
The course aims to introduce the foundational concepts and methods used in the field of artificial intelligence and provide students with skills to apply these techniques. Specifically the course aims to give students an overview of the following topics in artificial intelligence:
- searching for solutions to problems,
- reasoning and planning with certainty, 
- reasoning and planning under uncertainty,
- learning to act, and
- reasoning about other agents.

## What I have learned:
1.	Describe the core theoretical and conceptual frameworks, methods and practices which form the basis of artificial intelligence.
2.	Explain the properties and functions of a range of different artificial intelligence methods and to be able to connect a method to appropriate theoretical foundations.
3.	Effectively solve problems relating to artificial intelligence topics and applications discussed in class and in the literature.
4.	Implement techniques and methods from artificial intelligence using a high-level programming language.
5.	Effectively formulate real-world problems as problem representations solvable by existing techniques in artificial intelligence.
