In this case we will treate the heuristic as the manhattan distance between the current position and the destination, which is also the number of cells between the current position and destination. In order for this heuristic to be admissable it needs to not overrestimate the true lowest cost from the currrent position to the destination, in Exercise 3.2, the true lowest cost is the lowest number amongst all paths to the destination, taking the sum of the costs for each grid element. Since the lowest cost for any element is 1,the manhattan distance is indeed admissable.   "
